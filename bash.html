				<h2>Dear BASH,</h2>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>This is my first letter to you since you <b>changed</b> your adress. I hope you had a smooth <span id="move" style="color:white;">move</span> into your new place. How is your <b>cat</b> adjusting to the new place? While you were gone I was able to <b>make</b> a <b>list</b> of things we will need for our next get away! I love that you are so <b>open</b> to the idea of camping with me in the National Parks this summer. It can't come any faster. When you are <b>present</b> with me everything that mattered to me melts away. You are more of <b>man</b> compared to any of other people who have hurt me in this life. <b>Removing</b> you from my life would just kill me. I feel that we <b>complete</b> each other when we are together. I have faith that these letters to you will keep our spark alive, well at least till this summer.</p>
