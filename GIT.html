I initally thought that were mad at me since I didn't read your last letter correctly. I though you were saying my status at work was the only thing that was keeping us apart. But you made it clear to me that our differences make us stronger. You always push me to do my best in anything that I do and that is a reason why I love you so much. Being in a commited realationship with you is the best thing that could have ever happened to me. I wish that one day we will add each other to our family tree. </p>
