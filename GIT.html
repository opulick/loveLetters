				<p class="content2">I was a little worried you didn't like what I had to say in the last <em><strong>message</strong></em> so I am hear to clear things up with you. I <em><strong>initially</strong></em> thought that were mad at me since I didn't read your last letter correctly. I though you were saying my <em><strong>status</strong></em> at work was the only thing that was keeping us apart. But you made it clear to me that our <em><strong>differences</strong></em> make us stronger. You always <em><strong>push</strong></em> me to do my best in anything that I do and that is a reason why I love you so much. Being in a <em><strong>committed</strong></em> realationship with you is the best thing that could have ever happened to me. I wish that one day we will <em><strong>add</strong></em> each other to our family tree. keeping a <em><strong>log</strong></em> of our family tree will strength our roots and <em><strong>branches</strong></em>. Although there are family members are <em><strong>deleted</strong></em> from our lives they are still apart of us.  Eventually our two family trees will <em><strong>merge</strong></em> as one. Double <em><strong>checking</strong></em> with our realivitives would be a good idea incase we forgot someone. I desire that we will <em><strong>create</strong></em> our own unique branch. I'll <em><strong>rehash</strong></em> to you everything if you don't get these letters from me. </p>
