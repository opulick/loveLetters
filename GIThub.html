				<p>I miss you so much, that I wish there was a <em><strong>clone</strong></em> of you so you could be with me all the time. You are able to <em><strong>read me</strong></em> so well when I am with you. I feel that there is this force that <em><strong>pushes</strong></em> and <em><strong>pulls</strong></em> at me when I am away from you for too long. My only <em><strong>request</strong></em> is for you not to hold anything against me when we are at our worst. I vision our future that one day we will be able to <em><strong>merge</strong></em> our lives together and grow old together. I think it would be funny that either you or me will be <em><strong>forking</strong></em> food over to each other when we are old and wrinkly. If only there was a <em><strong>remote</strong></em> that would allow me to pass all the hard times and pause for all the good times with you. I need a full <em><strong>report</strong></em> on how your trip to Thailand was.</p>
